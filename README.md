# AI-Project
CESI FISE A3 AI Project


Notes:
- We can remove the following columns: Over18, EmployeeCount, StandardHours
- We're likely gonna need a classification model, random forest classifier seems to be good but we'll need to try out different models and compare their results
- Is it ethically moral to take gender and marital situation into consideration ? Would it bias the answer ?


No PPT, the jupyter file will be used for the presentation. Therefore it must be clean
